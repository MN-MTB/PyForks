# PyForks
Python Trailforks Library for interacting with Trailforks.com

## About

PyForks has been designed to help me automate much of the manual data aggregation I was doing in order to build metrics for my local city and state trail systems. For example: [wlmt.mn-mtb.com](https://wlmt.mn-mtb.com). The end goal of this project is the ability to make it much easier to pull data down that people are interested in and analyze it in a way that non-technical individuals can digest and understand impact in hopes of additional funding and intrest. 

## Installation
